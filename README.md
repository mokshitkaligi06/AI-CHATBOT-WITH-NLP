#🤖 AI Chatbot with NLP
🧠 Overview
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user input and respond conversationally. It is designed to simulate human-like conversations for use in customer support, FAQs, appointment booking, and more.

💡 Features
Intent recognition and entity extraction

Context-aware conversations

Predefined and generative responses

Support for small talk and FAQs

Multi-channel support (web, messenger, etc.)

Scalable and modular architecture

🛠️ Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
NLP Engine	spaCy / Rasa NLU / BERT
Backend	Python / Node.js / Flask
Chat Interface	React / Vue / WebSocket UI
Response Engine	Rule-based + ML/DL models
Database (optional)	MongoDB / PostgreSQL

📦 Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-chatbot-nlp.git
cd ai-chatbot-nlp
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or npm install
⚙️ Configuration
Update the config.yml or .env file with project settings:

yaml
Copy
Edit
language: "en"
pipeline:
  - name: "SpacyNLP"
  - name: "RegexFeaturizer"
  - name: "DIETClassifier"
  - name: "EntitySynonymMapper"
  - name: "ResponseSelector"
🧪 Training the NLP Model
Train the intent recognition and entity extraction model:

bash
Copy
Edit
rasa train  # or your custom script like train_model.py
🗣️ Running the Bot
Start the chatbot server:

bash
Copy
Edit
rasa run --enable-api  # for Rasa
# or
python app.py          # if using Flask or FastAPI
To launch the chatbot UI locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev  # for a React/Vue interface
💬 Chatbot Capabilities
🔍 Intent Recognition
Identifies what the user wants (e.g., book_appointment, greet, ask_faq).

🧾 Entity Extraction
Pulls important information like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "intent": "book_appointment",
  "entities": {
    "date": "tomorrow",
    "time": "3 PM"
  }
}
